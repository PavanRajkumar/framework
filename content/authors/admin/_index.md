I'm a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at USC. On the side, I make sure that all of my research labs' infrastructure is up and running 24x7. This involves getting my hands dirty in Linux, Networking, Scripting, Automation, Containers, Monitoring, Backups, and of course, answering those late night emails from users who forgot their login passwords!
